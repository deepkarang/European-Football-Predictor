## DESCRIPTION
A software bundle that uses various Machine Learning techniques to predict the outcome of Soccer Matches based on the performance ratings of the players on each team
The 2 methods being used currently are Linear Regression and a Multilayer Perceptron
European Soccer database being used, can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer#database.sqlite

## IN PROGRESS
Linear regression model sitting at 54% accuracy and Neural network currently sitting at 53% accuracy


## EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS

Install dependencies by running
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Simply run 
```python <file_name>``` 
To execute the corresponding Machine Learning model. This assumes 'database.sqlite' from the referenced link is placed in the same directory.
